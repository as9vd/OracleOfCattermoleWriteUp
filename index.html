            Now, for those just looking to get a quick glimpse of the project, here is an example run-through of my application. 
            In this example, I created a link between John Stones and Lee Cattermole.

            Here is another example. This time, I bridged the gap between Barcelona player Gavi, who was born in 2004, 
            and Manchester United legend Billy Meredith, who was born in 1874.

            Hello, my name is Asad. Today, I'm presenting a project 
            I worked on during the 2nd semester of the 2022-23 school year. 
            And, unlike my write-up for the deep learning project I made, I'll keep this one short and sweet.
            This project is a real-world application of the Breadth-First Search algorithm.
            Basically, I gathered the career data of over 50,000 footballers, past and present, 
            to create a nice little application that links any two players, ever (given they're both in the dataset).
            It is the football equivalent of the famous Oracle of Bacon, albeit I haven't yet chosen a central figure for the traversal.
            I will do that now. Lee Cattermole. There you go. Just done that on the spot. The Oracle of Cattermole.
            Sounds good. 
        </p>
        <div class="photo-container">
            <img class="image" src="media/cattermole.jpeg" style="width: 200px !important; height: 277px;" alt="Cattermole"/>
            <p class="caption">Figure 1: Lee Cattermole</p>
        </div>
        <p class="text-block">
            Now, I began working on this project because I like both football and the art of programming. 
            Having the opportunity to work towards the mastery of the Python language
            whilst being able to work with a dataset that interests me? Easy.
            Now, originally, I wanted to make use of a more sophisticated graph algorithm. Last semester, I took
            a graduate level course on algorithms, and I loved it. Especially the section on graphs.
            I really, really enjoyed diving deep into algorithms/topics like Ford-Fulkerson, Bellman-Ford, 
            A*, negative cycles, etc., and I seriously pushed myself to understand these algorithms/intuitions at the ground level,
            redoing their proofs by hand and coding up their implementations. I like networks!
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
            So, why did I ultimately settle on BFS as my graph algorithm of choice?
            Because it was the most simple, intuitive, and accessible. 
            Simply put, it's something cool I could show my mates. 
            Being able to connect Kylian Mbappe, one of the most talented footballers of our time,
            to a random Scotsman from the 1890sâ€”who played 5 times for the mighty Partick Thistle, 
            before disappearing off the face of the Earthâ€”is truly mind-blowing.
        </p>
        <div class="photo-container">
            <img class="image" src="media/mbappe.jpeg" style="width: 300px !important; height: 210px;" alt="Mbappe"/>
            <p class="caption">Figure 2: Mbappe</p>
        </div>
        <p class="text-block">
            On the contrary, I didn't think my mates would be impressed by me finding the minimum-spanning tree of this network I'd created.
            Or finding its min-cut/max-flow. 
            I think that, in the future, I'll utilise this massive dataset in more sophisticated ways (e.g. machine learning, clustering, etc.), 
            but for now, I was content to create The Oracle of Cattermole.

        <p class="text-block">
            To start, I used Wikipedia as my Single Source of Truth. 
            It's not perfect, but it's better than a lot of the other alternatives out there.
            Football doesn't have the luxury of being a predominantly American sport.
            Basketball and American football, for instance, 
            boast extensive statistical archives and player career records that span all the way back to the inceptions of both the NBA and the NFL, respectively.
            In football? Nothing of the sort. European sporting culture is different.
            There are official club records, but those are hard to come by. So, I settled on Wikipedia.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
            Thankfully, a lot of the pages were easily parseable. For instance, look at Harold Kane's Wikipedia page.
        </p>
        <div class="photo-container">
            <img class="image" src="media/kane_wiki.jpeg" style="width: 200px !important; height: 600px;" alt="Kane's Wikipedia Page"/>
            <p class="caption">Figure 3: Harry Edward Kane's Wikipedia Page</p>
        </div>
        <p class="text-block">
            Easy to maneuever. Information is structured consistently, and there aren't any weird, dream-like behaviours.
            Others, on the other hand, were not so easy to parse. Below is the Wikipedia page of Matthew Shaw, Blackpool legend.
        </p>
        <div class="photo-container">
            <img class="image" src="media/bignoseski.jpeg" style="width: 200px !important; height: 261px;" alt="Bignoseski's Wikipedia Page"/>
            <p class="caption">Figure 4: A Wind-Up</p>
        </div>
        <p class="text-block">
            Wow! Bignoseski. Someone was on a wind-up. However, silly pet names were the least of my issues. 
            The biggest issue I came across was below.
        </p>
        <div class="photo-container">
            <img class="image" src="media/bull.jpeg" style="width: 200px !important; height: 480px;" alt="Walter Bull's Wikipedia Page"/>
            <p class="caption">Figure 5: A Dream</p>
        </div>
        <p class="text-block">
            A complete dream. If you look closely, you can see that Mr. Bull was at Notts County
            for 101 years, even continuing his association with the Magpies for 43 years beyond his Earthly existence.
            Wow! Unfortunately for me, 
            Bull's Wikipedia page was not a one-off. Many other pages had incomplete years, misspelled club names,
            inaccurate durations, etc. 
            Therefore, with these limitations in mind, I imported/scraped the data in waves, 
            so I could check each player's data manually. For more information on this, 
            check the example JupyterLab Notebook I linked above, in the 'Examples' section.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
            Other than the fact that I had to gather the data in over 40 waves AND check if each player's information was valid, 
            it was pretty much smooth sailing from here.
            I created adjacencies by finding overlapping intervals amongst players who played for the same football club. 
            And, with 53k players in the dataset, that took a while. But, in the end, I put the adjacencies in a JSON file,
            and I created a Flask API endpoint to expose said JSON to my React app. Not as sophisticated as using a graph database like
            Neo4j, but it worked.

            As for the React app.. yeah, it wasn't too bad. useState(), useEffect(), all that jazz. 
            If you want to see the code, I linked it in the 'Examples section'. 
            I like React, and I think that I'm good at it. I enjoyed making the site.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
            For the search fields, I made use of the Trie data structure. 
            And for the constantly changing input in those search fields, 
            I used the useCallback hook (for the first time ever) in order to avoid unnecessary rerenders.

            Anyway, that's it for me. I kept it short and sweet, like I promised. Thank you for reading this. 
            I really would've enjoyed deploying it to the cloud for your use (with Neo4j support), but that's costly.
            Maybe in the future. For now, I feel good about this project. 
            I learned a lot whilst building it, and I certaintly honed numerous skills.
            Have a good rest of your day.
